On the project we are training a neural network so as to recognise images of leaves of fruits. 
We use the dataset given , including some thousands of images of fruit leaves to train the network with.
There is no automatic validation set given so the first challenge we face is  creating one , and we do so by
spliting the dataset to 80% training set and 20% validation set . In order to do so we use bash commands.
Afterwards we do some checks to see if the split was alright and then we start creating our model.We use
data augmentation as shown in the laboratories but not too much because after some tries we discovered that 
less data augmentation gives better results . Then considering the actual neural model , we first use the vgg16 
pretrained model and on top of it we add a few layers, namely a flatten layer and 2 pairs of dropout,dense layers.
We tried other models , with different combinations of layers and different types of pooling layers but in some cases
the results were worse and in some others the model could not compile due to dimention uncompatibility.
We may or may nt use early stopping since it does not make that of a difference in our experience.
Afterwards we unfreeze some of the layers of the pretrained vgg16 model and train the model again with a very low
learning rate so as to fine tune it . To train the model we use around 30 epochs , and tried different batch sizes.
In the end after a procedure of trial and error we conclude on the parameters that had the best final results ,
giving the best model .
